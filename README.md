# Deep-Rock-Save-Converter
A hastily made python script that allows easily and repeatable backups and conversions of a deep rock galactic save file between windows and steam.

# Some additional notes about this script
I made this script mostly for me and some friends to use, if you find some use out of it then thats pretty neat, however;
I am in no way claiming this is a professionally made script, it isn't.
I literally made this in about 3 hours, and ran into many issues which I solved in what I would call less than efficient mannors.

If you happen to be wondering how exactly this script works without having to run it, I'll give you a brief description:
This script takes your Steam version of deep rock galactic, your Windows store version of deep rock galactic, backs both up
and then copies one to the other, depending on your preference.
You can easily view all past save backups, and use them if something goes wrong (which it very well may)
Ultimately though, I would always recommend backing up your saves yourself before converting them with this script first, as things could always go wrong.
If any issues arrise, you can submit an issue report on this repo, though it may take some time for me to see it, and even longer to fix whatever issue it may be.

But again, please, always back up your save files yourself. You never know what might go wrong, this script may work perfectly for me, but machine differences can be pretty big when it comes to stuff like this.
